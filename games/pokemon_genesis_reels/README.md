1. **Tier 1 (Common)**: 20 Pokemon - Basic forms like Caterpie, Pidgey, Rattata
2. **Tier 2 (Uncommon)**: 51 Pokemon - First evolutions and less common Pokemon
3. **Tier 3 (Rare)**: 51 Pokemon - Starter Pokemon and strong evolved forms
4. **Tier 4 (Ultra Rare)**: 12 Pokemon - Final starter evolutions and powerful Pokemon
5. **Tier 5 (Epic)**: 8 Pokemon - Pseudo-legendaries and Eevee evolutions
6. **Tier 6 (Legendary)**: 5 Pokemon - Mythical and Legendary Pokemon

### Special Symbols

- **Professor Oak (Wild)**: Substitutes for all Pokemon in cluster formation
- **Master Ball (Scatter)**: Triggers Catch 'Em All Bonus (3+ required)
- **Evolution Stones**: Enable Pokemon evolution when adjacent to winning clusters
  - Fire Stone, Water Stone, Thunder Stone, Leaf Stone, Moon Stone

### Evolution Mechanics

Pokemon can evolve when their winning clusters are adjacent to compatible Evolution Stones:

- **Stage 1 Evolution**: 2.5x multiplier (e.g., Charmander ‚Üí Charmeleon)
- **Stage 2 Evolution**: 4.0x multiplier (e.g., Charmeleon ‚Üí Charizard)

### Cascading System

When clusters win, symbols explode and new symbols fall with progressive multipliers:
**1x ‚Üí 2x ‚Üí 3x ‚Üí 5x ‚Üí 8x ‚Üí 12x ‚Üí 15x** (capped at 15x)

## üéä Bonus Features

### 1. Evolutionary Frenzy (Free Spins)
- **Trigger**: 3+ Evolution Stones anywhere on the grid
- **Feature**: 8-20 free spins with automatic Pokemon evolutions
- **Enhancement**: 30% chance per symbol to auto-evolve each spin
- **Multipliers**: Enhanced up to 25x during free spins

### 2. Catch 'Em All Bonus
- **Trigger**: 3+ Master Balls anywhere on the grid
- **Feature**: Interactive ball-throwing mini-game simulation
- **Payout**: Win multiplier scales with Master Ball count
- **Range**: 5x to 25x bet multiplier

### 3. Battle Arena Challenge
- **Trigger**: Random 10% chance after any Legendary Pokemon cluster win
- **Feature**: Turn-based battle simulation against Gym Leaders
- **Mechanics**: Win chance improves with Pok√©dex completion rate
- **Opponents**: Brock, Misty, Lt. Surge, Erika, Koga, Sabrina, Blaine, Giovanni

### 4. Persistent Pok√©dex System
- **Feature**: Track all Pokemon encountered across sessions
- **Progress**: Visual completion percentage and caught Pokemon list
- **Benefits**: Higher Pok√©dex completion improves Battle Arena win rates
