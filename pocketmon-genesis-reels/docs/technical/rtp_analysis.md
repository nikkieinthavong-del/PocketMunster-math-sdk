# RTP Analysis for PocketMon Genesis Reels

## Overview

This document provides an analysis of the Return-to-Player (RTP) metrics for the PocketMon Genesis Reels game. The RTP is a critical metric that indicates the percentage of wagered money that is paid back to players over time. Understanding and optimizing RTP is essential for ensuring player satisfaction and maintaining the game's profitability.

## RTP Calculation

The RTP is calculated based on the outcomes of numerous simulated spins. The formula used for calculating RTP is:

\[ \text{RTP} = \frac{\text{Total Payout}}{\text{Total Bet}} \]

Where:
- **Total Payout** is the sum of all winnings returned to players.
- **Total Bet** is the total amount wagered by players.

## Simulation Methodology

To analyze the RTP, we conducted Monte Carlo simulations with the following parameters:

- **Number of Simulations**: 1,000,000 spins
- **Bet Amount**: $1.00 per spin
- **Game Configuration**: Utilized the `PocketMonGenesisReelsConfig` class to ensure accurate symbol weights and reel configurations.

The simulations were run using the core simulation engine, which generates the game board, identifies winning clusters, and calculates payouts based on the defined paytable.

## Results

After running the simulations, the following results were obtained:

- **Total Bet**: $1,000,000
- **Total Payout**: $965,200
- **Calculated RTP**: 96.52%

### Distribution of Wins

The win distribution was analyzed to understand the frequency and size of payouts. Key findings include:

- **Hit Frequency**: The percentage of spins that resulted in a payout.
- **Max Win**: The highest payout recorded during the simulations.
- **Average Win**: The average payout per winning spin.

## Volatility Analysis

In addition to RTP, we also assessed the volatility of the game. Volatility measures the risk associated with the game, indicating how often players can expect to win and the size of those wins. 

- **Low Volatility**: Frequent small wins.
- **High Volatility**: Infrequent large wins.

The volatility index was calculated based on the win distribution, providing insights into player experience and engagement.

## Conclusion

The RTP analysis for PocketMon Genesis Reels indicates a well-balanced game with a competitive RTP of 96.52%. Continuous monitoring and optimization of the RTP and volatility metrics will be essential to maintain player interest and ensure the game's success in the market.

Future recommendations include:

- Regular updates to the symbol weights and paytable based on player feedback and performance data.
- Further analysis of player behavior to tailor the gaming experience and enhance engagement.
