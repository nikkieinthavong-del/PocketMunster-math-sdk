# Troubleshooting Tips for PocketMon Genesis Reels Deployment

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Environment Setup Issues
- **Problem:** Dependencies not installing correctly.
  - **Solution:** Ensure you have the correct version of Python (3.10) and Node.js (18.x) installed. Use `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip` to upgrade pip before installing dependencies.

### 2. Docker Issues
- **Problem:** Docker container fails to start.
  - **Solution:** Check the Docker logs using `docker-compose logs` to identify the issue. Ensure that the Docker daemon is running and that you have sufficient permissions.

### 3. Asset Loading Problems
- **Problem:** Game assets not loading or displaying incorrectly.
  - **Solution:** Verify that all asset paths in the code are correct. Ensure that the assets are present in the specified directories. Use the AssetLoader utility to check for missing assets.

### 4. Simulation Errors
- **Problem:** Monte Carlo simulations return unexpected results.
  - **Solution:** Review the simulation parameters and ensure they align with the expected configurations. Check the `math-engine/src/simulation/core_engine.py` for any logic errors.

### 5. Performance Issues
- **Problem:** Game runs slowly or lags during gameplay.
  - **Solution:** Optimize asset sizes and reduce the number of simultaneous animations. Use the performance testing script to identify bottlenecks.

### 6. API Integration Failures
- **Problem:** API calls return errors or unexpected responses.
  - **Solution:** Check the API documentation for correct usage. Ensure that the server is running and accessible. Use tools like Postman to test API endpoints independently.

### 7. Configuration Errors
- **Problem:** Game configuration not applying correctly.
  - **Solution:** Ensure that the `PocketMonGenesisReelsConfig` class is correctly instantiated and that the configuration file is being loaded properly. Check for typos in the configuration keys.

### 8. Bonus Features Not Triggering
- **Problem:** Bonus features do not activate as expected.
  - **Solution:** Review the bonus trigger conditions in the `game_config.py` file. Ensure that the game state is correctly updated to reflect the triggering conditions.
