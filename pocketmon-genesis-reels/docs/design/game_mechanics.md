# Game Mechanics Overview

## 1. Game Objective
The primary objective of PocketMon Genesis Reels is to create winning combinations of symbols on the game grid, which consists of 7 reels and 7 rows. Players aim to achieve the highest possible payout by landing clusters of matching symbols.

## 2. Symbols
The game features a variety of symbols, including:
- **PocketMon Symbols**: Representing different Pok√©mon, each with a base value.
- **Wild Symbols**: Substitute for any other symbol to create winning combinations.
- **Scatter Symbols**: Trigger special features when a certain number are landed.
- **Bonus Symbols**: Activate bonus rounds or free spins.

## 3. Reel Strips
Each reel is composed of a strip of symbols, with varying weights assigned to each symbol. The weights determine the likelihood of each symbol appearing on the reel during a spin.

## 4. Winning Combinations
Winning combinations are formed by landing clusters of 5 or more matching symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The payout for each combination is determined by the symbol's base value and the size of the cluster.

## 5. Cluster Pay Table
The game includes a cluster pay table that specifies the payouts for different cluster sizes for each symbol type. Higher-tier symbols yield greater payouts.

## 6. Evolution Mechanic
Certain symbols can evolve into higher-tier symbols under specific conditions, enhancing their value and potentially leading to larger payouts. Evolution is triggered by landing specific symbols in adjacent positions.

## 7. Bonus Features
The game includes various bonus features, such as:
- **Free Spins**: Triggered by landing a set number of scatter symbols, allowing players to spin without wagering additional credits.
- **Bonus Rounds**: Special mini-games that offer additional opportunities for payouts.

## 8. Cascading Reels
After a winning combination is formed, the symbols involved in the win disappear, and new symbols cascade down to fill the empty spaces. This can create additional winning combinations in a single spin.

## 9. RTP and Volatility
The game is designed to have a return-to-player (RTP) percentage of approximately 96.52%, with volatility levels adjusted to provide a balanced gaming experience.

## 10. User Interface
The user interface is designed to be intuitive, providing players with clear information about their current balance, bet amounts, and potential payouts. Animations and sound effects enhance the overall gaming experience.
