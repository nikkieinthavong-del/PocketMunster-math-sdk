## Known Issues and Limitations

### Environment Variable Dependencies

**Issue**: Pipeline depends on `POCKETMON_SIGN_SECRET` environment variable
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Workaround**: Falls back to default key with warning
- **Solution**: Implement proper key management integration
- **Security Note**: Document proper secret handling in production

### Performance Scaling

**Issue**: Large asset collections may exceed memory limits
- **Impact**: Low (current datasets are small)
- **Mitigation**: Batch processing and streaming where possible
- **Monitoring**: Track memory usage in performance profiling
- **Threshold**: Works well up to ~1000 files, 100MB total size

### Golden Test Baseline Management

**Issue**: Golden files can become stale or inconsistent
- **Impact**: Low
- **Mitigation**: Regular golden file review and validation
- **Process**: Include golden file updates in code review
- **Automation**: Consider automated golden file health checks

### Policy Guard False Positives

**Issue**: Security pattern detection may flag legitimate code
- **Impact**: Low
- **Mitigation**: Configurable ignore patterns and allowlists
- **Tuning**: Regular review and refinement of detection rules
- **User Training**: Document common false positive scenarios
