# Animations & Reactions

This section documents the frontend animation system and how it reacts to math events.

- Animation lifecycle and engine integration
- Stories (scripted multi-step sequences)
- Reveals (delayed symbol/feature reveals)
- Symbol reactions (on-hit, on-collect, explode, tumble)
- Reel reactions (spin, stop, bounce, nudge)
- Scene transitions (enter/exit, cutscenes)
- Timing, easing, and performance notes
