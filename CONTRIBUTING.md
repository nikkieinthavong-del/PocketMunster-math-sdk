# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## Getting started

- Prereqs: Node 20.x, npm 10.x, Python 3.12 (for math-side work)
- Install deps:
  - Node: `npm ci`
  - Python: see `README.md` (Makefile targets available)
- Recommended VS Code extensions: Prettier and markdownlint

## Useful scripts

- Type check: `npm run typecheck`
- Build demo runtime: `npm run build:demo`
- Tests: `npm test` (or `npm run test:watch`)
- Quick sim: `npm run simulate -- --spins=200`
- Bonus sim: `npm run simulate:bonus -- --spins=20000`
- Calibrate RTP: `npm run calibrate:total` (or `:big`, `:1m`)

## Formatting and linting

- Prettier is the source of truth. Run `npm run format` to format the repo.
- CI runs a scoped `format:check` and `lint:md` against README to keep noise low.
- Pre-commit: Husky + lint-staged formats staged files and runs markdownlint on README.

## Pull requests

- Branch from `main`; use a descriptive name: `feat/...`, `fix/...`, or `chore/...`.
- Keep commits focused and include a clear message.
- Ensure the following run locally before pushing:
  - `npm run typecheck`
  - `npm test`
  - A quick sim (`npm run simulate -- --spins=200`)
- Open a PR and confirm CI is green.

## Style and EOLs

- `.editorconfig` enforces 2-space indent (4 for Python) and LF line endings.
- `.gitattributes` normalizes LF for text and marks binary assets.

## Docs

- MkDocs lives in `docs/`. Large lint/format sweeps should be separated into their own PR to reduce noise.

## Troubleshooting Dev Containers (Windows)

If Docker Desktop can't connect (server null / 500) or VS Code Dev Containers fails:

- Ensure WSL2 is healthy: run `wsl --status` and `wsl -l -v`. Default version should be 2.
- Check disk space on C:. Docker Desktop stores its WSL disk under `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Docker/wsl` by default.
- If out of space or Docker is stuck:
  1. Quit Docker Desktop.
  2. `wsl --shutdown` (in an elevated terminal if needed).
  3. `wsl --unregister docker-desktop` (and `docker-desktop-data` if present).
  4. Delete `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Docker/wsl` and `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Docker/log.txt*`.
  5. Start Docker Desktop and wait for initialization to complete.
- Sanity test: `docker run --rm hello-world` should succeed.

Tip: You can move Docker's disk image to another drive from Docker Desktop >
Settings > Resources > WSL integration > Advanced (or switch to Hyper-V backend).
